Trivia Game
This is the simpler version of the Trivia Game assignment for UMN Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp.  Project was due 8/7/2018.

This is a game identifying runners from the card game Android:Netrunner.  Part of the goal was to record quiz answers and tabulate them, but the main issue here was getting the timer to work with the quiz.
